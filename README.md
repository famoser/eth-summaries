# eth-summaries
Some summaries created for eth courses. If you want to use some of these be aware that:

- they are written to be helpful to memorize facts, and explicitly not to understand the course
- none has been reviewed by professors, and only a few ones by fellow students
- the quality varies greatly with how well I've liked and understood the course

I will list all summaries and my perceived level of quality. The first few summaries are sometimes messed up as I was getting used to the .fex format (https://github.com/famoser/FexCompiler).

## contribute
If you've found mistakes or spelling errors feel free to create a pull request (edit the .fex files like any other text file). If you make changes to the meaning of phrases please cite a source (to ensure the summaries never get worse), unless the error is obivous.
