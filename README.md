# ETH summaries
Summaries created for ETHZ courses. If you want to use some of these please be aware that:

- they are written to be helpful to memorize facts, and explicitly not to understand the course
- none has been reviewed by professors, and only a few ones by fellow students
- the perceived quality is not necessarily linked with how well I've liked and understood the course

I will list all summaries and my perceived level of quality. 
Generally, the newer the summary, the more consistent is the structure & the wording.

Comments:  
Object Databases (short) is without general statements like "can be configured" and perceived irrelevant details (syntax for dead libraries) but may not be complete.

## contribute
The summaries are written in the .fex format (https://github.com/famoser/FexCompiler), and then compiled to latex.
