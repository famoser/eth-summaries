# ETH summaries
Some summaries created for eth courses. If you want to use some of these be aware that:

- they are written to be helpful to memorize facts, and explicitly not to understand the course
- none has been reviewed by professors, and only a few ones by fellow students
- the quality varies greatly with how well I've liked and understood the course

I will list all summaries and my perceived level of quality. 
Genereally, the later the summary the better. 
It needs some time to get good at it, and I first needed to get used to the .fex format (https://github.com/famoser/FexCompiler).
